# ML-Tagger
Assign tags to images using machine learning (WIP)

## 64-bit?!
I usually make all my projects available on 32-bit machines due to the fact that I used to use one and had to endure the pain of not being able to run many programs. However, this program is x64-only due to the fact that I really really don't want to spend 2 weeks compiling an ML library. 100 stars for 32-bit release B)
